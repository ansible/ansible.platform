module: role_team_assignment
author: Rohit Thakur (@rohitthakur2590)
short_description: Gives a team permission to a resource or an organization.
description:
    - Use this module to assign team or organization related roles to a team.
    - After creation, the assignment cannot be edited, but can be deleted to remove those permissions.
    - Not all role assignments are valid. See Limitations below.
notes:
  - This module is subject to limitations of the RBAC system in AAP 2.6.
  - Global roles (e.g. Platform Auditor) cannot be assigned to teams.
  - Team roles cannot be assigned to another team (Team Admin â†’ Team is not supported).
  - Organization Member role cannot be assigned to teams.
  - Only resource-scoped organization roles (e.g. "Organization Inventory Admin", "Organization Credential Admin") can be meaningfully assigned to teams.
  - Attempting unsupported role assignments will result in errors.
